The data comes from the Vancouver Open Data Catalogue. It was extracted on 2017-07-18 and it contains 530,652 records from 2003-01-01 to 2017-07-13. The original data set contains coordinates in UTM Zone 10 (columns X and Y). I also included Latitude and Longitude, which I converted using this spreadsheet that can be found here.

There's also a Google Trends data that shows how often a search-term is entered relative to the total search-volume. From Google Trends:

"Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. Likewise a score of 0 means the term was less than 1% as popular as the peak."
